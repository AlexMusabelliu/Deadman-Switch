# Deadman-s-Switch
A program that acts as a dead man's switch for your computer when activated and only allows further use after either a restart or a PIN is entered.

# Use
To use it, install the dependencies (for now) and launch the program through python; press F4 to enable the switch, and press it again to disable it. Inside of the code, you can change the password (self.password), which is limited to be numbers only. When entering the PIN, it may be necessary to click first and activate the main window.
